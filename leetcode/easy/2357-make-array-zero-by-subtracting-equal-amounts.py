Hint
You are given a non-negative integer array nums. In one operation, you must:

Choose a positive integer x such that x is less than or equal to the smallest non-zero element in nums.
Subtract x from every positive element in nums.
Return the minimum number of operations to make every element in nums equal to 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,0,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
In the first operation, choose x = 1. Now, nums = [0,4,0,2,4].
In the second operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,2,0,0,2].
In the third operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,0,0,0,0].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation: Each element in nums is already 0 so no operations are needed.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 100
