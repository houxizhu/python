Hint
Given two integers, num and t. A number x is achievable if it can become equal to num after applying the following operation at most t times:

Increase or decrease x by 1, and simultaneously increase or decrease num by 1.
Return the maximum possible value of x.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 4, t = 1

Output: 6

Explanation:

Apply the following operation once to make the maximum achievable number equal to num:

Decrease the maximum achievable number by 1, and increase num by 1.
Example 2:

Input: num = 3, t = 2

Output: 7

Explanation:

Apply the following operation twice to make the maximum achievable number equal to num:

Decrease the maximum achievable number by 1, and increase num by 1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= num, t <= 50
