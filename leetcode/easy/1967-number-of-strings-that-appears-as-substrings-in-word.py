Hint
Given an array of strings patterns and a string word, return the number of strings in patterns that exist as a substring in word.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
- "a" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "abc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "bc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".
3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.
Example 2:

Input: patterns = ["a","b","c"], word = "aaaaabbbbb"
Output: 2
Explanation:
- "a" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
- "b" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
- "c" does not appear as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.
Example 3:

Input: patterns = ["a","a","a"], word = "ab"
Output: 3
Explanation: Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word "ab".
 

Constraints:

1 <= patterns.length <= 100
1 <= patterns[i].length <= 100
1 <= word.length <= 100
patterns[i] and word consist of lowercase English letters.
